- NEW       : New features introduced in this release

		** Morris Charts (based on rapheal.js engine)
   		   - 12 additional unique charts are now introduced with this theme (works on IE8+)

		** This theme now Includes LESS
		   - You should be able to control and manipulate most of the basic components by editing                                                 
                     queries. It is advised to compile your LESS to CSS before deployment

		     ~.Please see LESS_EXAMPLE.html for the proper setup.~


		NOTES ON {LESS}:
		===============
		You should be able to control and manipulate most of the basic components by editing 'variable.less' 
		file. Please note on IE8, you will not be able to see the media queries.

		This was a turn around conversion from CSS to LESS due to the popular demand for a LESS version 
		of Jarvis Theme. There will be significant improvements in the future of the LESS file structure. 

	

- Jquery    : Added/amended jQuery for the following:

		** Upgraded to jquery 1.9 (Although jquery.migrate.js is there for your use - 
					  it is not required with the current plugins)

		   - Update jQuery core to 1.8.3 and jQuery UI core to 1.9.2

		** Replaced the plugin "iButton" with "bootstrapSwitch" - serves as an increased performance
